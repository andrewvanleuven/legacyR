# Legacy Regions Database Codebook

Welcome to the online codebook for the legacy regions research dataset. The data are comprised of three groups of variables: controls, assets, and liabilities. This codebook describes each set of variables in terms of:

* *meaning* — how exactly the variable is to be interpreted
* *source* — where the variable was collected from 
* *geographic extent* — whether the variable is measured at the MSA level or at the level of the MSA's principal city

## Control Variables

| **Variable**    | **Description**                   | **Source     | **Geography** |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| cbsa_fips       | Unique ID for each MSA            | --           | MSA       |

| sqmi            | Square mileage of each MSA        | Census TIGER | MSA       |
| population_2005 | Population of each MSA in 2005    |              | MSA       |
